# Post-Clone Setup Guide for Repository

As a full-stack software engineer, I'll provide a methodical approach for setting up this project after cloning it from GitHub. This guide follows best practices for modern web application development.

## Step 1: Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd [repository-directory-name]
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

The project appears to be a React-based application with various UI components. Install all required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or if using yarn
yarn install
```

## Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit the environment file with your configuration
nano .env
```

Ensure you configure:

- API endpoints
- Authentication services
- Any third-party service keys

## Step 4: Verify Asset Directories

Based on the code, ensure these directories exist in your public folder:

```bash
mkdir -p public/assets/books
mkdir -p public/assets/icons
mkdir -p public/logos
```

## Step 5: Run Development Server

```bash
npm start
# or with yarn
yarn start
```

The application should start on http://localhost:3000

## Step 6: Set Up Database (if applicable)

If the application uses PostgreSQL as mentioned in the tech stack:

```bash
# Create database
createdb filkom_pedia_db

# Run migrations (if using a migration system)
npm run migrate
# or
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```

## Step 7: Run Tests

```bash
npm test
# or
yarn test
```

## Step 8: Build for Production (when ready)

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

## Technical Considerations

1. **Authentication Setup**:

- The code shows an AuthContext implementation
- Ensure proper configuration for user authentication
- Check for JWT token handling or session management

2. **Data Management**:

- Review mock data in components like Dashboard.js and BookDetail.js
- Replace with actual API calls when connecting to backend

3. **Image Assets**:

- The application references several image paths:
    - `/assets/books/android-book.jpg`
    - `/assets/icons/eye-icon.svg`
    - `/assets/icons/cart-icon.svg`
    - `/logos/android-logo.png`
- Ensure these files exist or replace with appropriate alternatives

4. **Component Structure**:

- The repository contains well-structured React components
- Familiarize yourself with the component hierarchy before making changes

5. **CSS Approach**:

- The project uses separate CSS files for components
- Be consistent with this pattern when adding new features

6. **Routing Configuration**:

- Review the routing setup (likely in an App.js file)
- Note protected routes and authentication requirements

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. If you encounter missing dependencies:

```bash
   npm install --save [missing-package]
```

2. For permission issues with directories:

```bash
   chmod -R 755 public/assets
```

3. If API endpoints aren't responding:

- Check the backend server status
- Verify API URLs in environment variables
- Check for CORS configuration

4. For build optimization issues:

```bash
   npm run build -- --profile
```

Following these steps will ensure you have a properly configured development environment for this React-based e-commerce application with book management features.
